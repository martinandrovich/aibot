- change CoG to improve traction
- push(n) and forward(n) for consectuive forward movements -> "..fff.." to "..f3.."
- replace uturn() with turn("around")
- back() uses follow_until_intersection
- test code (square test, push test) -> mocap trajectory tracking (?)
- tune constants (pid, dist etc.)
- wider gripper (?)
